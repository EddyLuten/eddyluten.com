Hi, I'm **Eddy Luten** and I'm a **freelance software developer** with over a decade of professional experience based out of the **San Francisco Bay Area**. Over the course of my career I've discovered a passion for building systems that solve problems efficiently.

You may also know me as the guy who wrote [openglbook.com](http://openglbook.com) or from various other [Open Source things](https://github.com/EddyLuten). Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:eddyluten@gmail.com) if you need help solving a problem and you think I could help. I'm also available to mentor or advise beginner developers.

## What I Do

I've been lucky enough to be exposed to a large number of programming languages, frameworks, and technologies over the years, including:

* Ruby on Rails
* PHP
* MVC.NET
* Rust
* C and C++
* OpenGL
* Much more, detailed on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddyluten)

Also, I tend have a bias towards performance optimization, search engine optimization (SEO), greenfield development, and defining development processes and best practices.

## Background

I've been programming since I was about 10 years old and I'm still cranking out code every day, though for the last 12 years or so professionally.

I got started programming simple games in QBasic on my dad's 386 in the early 90's, and soon moved on to Visual Basic when Windows 3.1 came around, which I used for quite a while. I didn't get much training on programming, learning mostly from help files and MS-DOS manuals. I am Dutch, so reading English literature was also a bit of a challenge back then. It wasn't until much later that I snagged a copy of Delphi 4 and a book to teach me *proper* programming. Though, I have to credit Microsoft for teaching me a large part of my English vocabulary.

Through learning Delphi, everything began to fall into place for me, and with getting an Internet connection in 1998, the programming floodgates were opened. I learned about C, C++, Windows programming, and OpenGL which was gaining popularity through gaming at the time. But most of all, the Internet itself was interesting and new, and I wanted to learn web development. I did by learning ASP and PHP soon after, which cemented my desire to become a professional programmer.

In 2000, I finished high school and pursued a degree in Information and Communications Technology. I moved from The Netherlands to Florida in late 2004 where got my first job as a web developer in 2005. In 2012, I joined a startup named [Bunndle](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bunndle#/entity) in Palo Alto doing Windows programming and moved to Silicon Valley where I still live today.
