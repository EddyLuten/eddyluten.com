Hi, I'm **Eddy Luten** and I'm a **software engineer** with over a decade of professional experience based out of the **San Francisco Bay Area**. Over the course of my career I've discovered a passion for building systems that solve problems efficiently.

I currently work at [Murj](http://www.murj.com/) as Principal Software Engineer.

You may also know me as the guy who wrote [openglbook.com](http://openglbook.com) or from various other [Open Source things](/projects).

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:eddyluten@gmail.com) if you need help solving a problem and you think I could help. I'm also available to mentor or advise junior developers.

## What I Do

[This is what I'm working on now.](/now).

I've been lucky enough to be exposed to a large number of programming languages, frameworks, and technologies over the years, including:

* Ruby on Rails
* React
* PHP
* AngularJS
* MVC.NET
* Rust
* C and C++
* OpenGL
* Much more, detailed on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddyluten)

Also, I enjoy startups, performance optimization, search engine optimization (SEO), greenfield development, and defining development processes and best practices.
