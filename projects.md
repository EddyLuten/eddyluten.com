Here are some personal projects I have worked on.

* [Sort Hangouts Google Chrome Extension](https://github.com/EddyLuten/sort-hangouts) &middot; 2018 (MIT Licensed)

    A [Google Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sort-hangouts-tab-in-gmai/kidpfddmdpkgilenchiaeehgfilnhapf) to sort the Google Hangouts tab in GMail by status.

* [dotfiles](https://github.com/EddyLuten/dotfiles) &middot; 2018 - present (MIT Licensed)

    I like being able to get up and running quickly after installing my OS, so I keep my dotfiles version controlled.

* [Atom Line-Breaker Package](https://github.com/EddyLuten/line-breaker) &middot; 2015 - 2018 (MIT Licensed)

    I often had the need to break lines by my preferred line boundary settings and had no way of doing so using Atom. So, I wrote a package to do so.
