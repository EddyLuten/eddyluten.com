<p>Hi, I’m <strong>Eddy Luten</strong> and I’m a <strong>freelance software developer</strong> with over a decade of professional experience based out of the <strong>San Francisco Bay Area</strong>. Over the course of my career I’ve discovered a passion for building systems that solve problems efficiently.</p>

<p>You may also know me as the guy who wrote <a href="http://openglbook.com">openglbook.com</a> or from various other <a href="https://github.com/EddyLuten">Open Source things</a>. Feel free to <a href="mailto:eddyluten@gmail.com">get in touch</a> if you need help solving a problem and you think I could help. I’m also available to mentor or advise beginner developers.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-do">What I Do</h2>

<p>I’ve been lucky enough to be exposed to a large number of programming languages, frameworks, and technologies over the years, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>MVC.NET</li>
  <li>Rust</li>
  <li>C and C++</li>
  <li>OpenGL</li>
  <li>Much more, detailed on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddyluten">LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I tend have a bias towards performance optimization, search engine optimization (SEO), greenfield development, and defining development processes and best practices.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/showing.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;" /></p>

<p>I’ve been programming since I was about 10 years old and I’m still cranking out code every day, though for the last 12 years or so professionally.</p>

<p>I got started programming simple games in QBasic on my dad’s 386 in the early 90’s, and soon moved on to Visual Basic when Windows 3.1 came around, which I used for quite a while. I didn’t get much training on programming, learning mostly from help files and MS-DOS manuals. I am Dutch, so reading English literature was also a bit of a challenge back then. It wasn’t until much later that I snagged a copy of Delphi 4 and a book to teach me <em>proper</em> programming. Though, I have to credit Microsoft for teaching me a large part of my English vocabulary.</p>

<p>Through learning Delphi, everything began to fall into place for me, and with getting an Internet connection in 1998, the programming floodgates were opened. I learned about C, C++, Windows programming, and OpenGL which was gaining popularity through gaming at the time. But most of all, the Internet itself was interesting and new, and I wanted to learn web development. I did by learning ASP and PHP soon after, which cemented my desire to become a professional programmer.</p>

<p>In 2000, I finished high school and pursued a degree in Information and Communications Technology. I moved from The Netherlands to Florida in late 2004 where got my first job as a web developer in 2005. In 2012, I joined a startup named <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bunndle#/entity">Bunndle</a> in Palo Alto doing Windows programming and moved to Silicon Valley where I still live today.</p>
